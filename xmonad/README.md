##My Config For Xmonad
It's a fork of DistroTubs Xmonad config, with my own key bindings, scratch pads ((MOD + D) for discord, (MOD + H) for htop and, (MOD + SHIFT + ENTER) for a terminal), most of the layouts turned off and a spiral/Fibonacci layout added, I removed the window borders dew to  the bake in immersion in games.
