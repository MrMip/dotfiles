# Description

__MipShot__ is a fronted for Maim, that is best used when bound to a key (In my config I have it bound to MOD+Shift+c).

__NRC__ turns tow commands to disconnect for nordvpn and then connect to one (in my ZSH config its "rc").

__MVPI__ makes it easer to install vim plugins via pathogen by just typing (if you use my zshrc) "pvim GIT REPOSITORY".
